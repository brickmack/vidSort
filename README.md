# vidSort
Command line utility to list duration and title of all files in a directory. Useful for manual file de-duplication. Built around ffprobe

#Flags
  -s, -sa (not yet implemented): sort by duration (ascending)
  -sd (not yet implemented): sort by duration (descending)
  -m: only show files with matching durations
  -v: verbose (not yet implemented, always verbose)
  -h: help (not yet implemented)

  Target directory must always be the first argument!

#Future plans:
  ascending/descending sort
  verbose/quiet mode
  help
  more supported extensions
    
Might reimplement in c or python later
